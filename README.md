# Typing Test Project

I made this Typing Test really inspired by how the way MonkeyType.com feels
when practicing. This is my first heavy project and I learned many modules/library
with it. Later I might make this game online and make it cleaner by separating Classes
to their own .py files and then creating a main.py to run the game.
